  title:        "BCD to Decimal Decoder"
  description:  "Converts a BCD input into a decimal output"
  how_it_works: "Accepts BCD through 4 input pins, and outputs the decimal equivalent (output pins 0 to 7). This is a functional clone of the DM7447, but does not include values 8 and 9 due to package constraints."
  how_to_test:  "Write to the BCD input (IN0:0, IN1:2, IN2:4, IN3:8). One corresponding decimal output pin will be driven high."
  external_hw:  "None"
